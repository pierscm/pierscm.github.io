Prior to enrolling in a computer science program, I spent a lot of my free time reading about subjects related to software development that interested me. This was a fun, hands on way to gain experience with technologies that are being used across the industry today. 

The lessons I have learned through traditional coursework have been invaluable, but I miss the thrill that comes with researching and implementing solutions based on... whatever interests and **_inspires me_**. So this blog is my attempt to get back into that flow and hopefully work on some fun projects while learning new skills. This may range from:

1. Web Development 
* Right now I'm eager to learn a bit more about the MEAN Stack
* And **_Ruby_** for rapid development
2. Algorithms
* My class has been awesome and very hands on, but I hope to gain more experience putting complex algorithms to the test in real-world applications.
3. Machine Learning 
* One of my primary motivations for getting into Computer Science and software development, I've yet to learn much on this subject at all.

Working while being a full-time student has been challenging, but its my hope that I can spend a few hours each week learning about the areas that interest me most.
